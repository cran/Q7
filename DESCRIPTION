Description: 
    Construct message-passing style objects with types and features. Q7 types uses composition instead of inheritance in creating derived types, allowing defining any code segment as feature and associating any feature to any object. Compared to R6, Q7 is simpler and more flexible, and is more friendly in syntax.
